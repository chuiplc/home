	<p> Here are some of the information of the  
	NBA championships from the past 5 years. </p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h3> Golden State Warriors: 2014 - 2015 </h3>
	
	<p> The Golden State Warriors won their third 
	NBA championship title after forty years, since 
	1975. The “Most Valuable Player” was given to 
	Stephen Curry, who only played in the NBA for 
	six years at the time. Stephen Curry and Andre 
	Iguodala led the way, both with 25 points each. 
	Draymond Green scored in 16 points, 11 rebounds, 
	and 10 assists, also known as a triple double 
	(where a player gains double digits in three 
	categories of the sport of basketball). </p>

	<br> <br> <br>
	
	<h3> Cleveland Cavaliers: 2015 - 2016 </h3>
	
	<p> One of the most incredible comebacks in NBA 
	history. Beginning with a rough start, they were
	losing to a 3 to 1 lead of the Golden State Warriors 
	in the finals. However, game by game, they started 
	to catch up, in which eventually led up to a 3 
	to 3 tie. Avenging their loss from last year, they
	took the championship title. They not only became
	the first title for the Cleveland Cavaliers, but 
	also broke the Cleveland Curse (a sports superstition
	claiming that the city of Cleveland centered on the 
	failure to win a championship in any major league sport).
	They were the first NBA team to catch up in a finals
	3 to 1 deficit. </p>

	<br> <br> <br>
	
	<h3> Golden State Warriors: 2016 - 2017 </h3>
	
	<p> After the trade of Kevin Durant from Oklahoma City
	Thunder to the Golden State Warriors. In the postseason,
	the team set a record of the most consecutive wins in 
	the playoffs, which were 12 games in a row. They, again,
	matched up with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the finals. 
	However, they dominated the team 4 - 1 in wins, and won
	the Golden State Warriors’ fourth championship title. 
	This was also the first franchise win for Kevin Durant,
	who won the Finals “Most Valuable Player” as well. </p>

	<br> <br> <br>
	
	<h3> Golden State Warriors: 2017 - 2018 </h3>
	
	<p> Even though they did not win as many times as last 
	year, the Golden State Warriors still managed it to make
	it through the playoffs and into the finals with the 
	Cleveland Cavaliers once again. Though this time, they 
	swept the Cavaliers 4 - 0, and had a repeat (winning 
	the finals two times back to back), making it the 5th
	championship title of the Golden State Warriors. Kevin
	Durant was the NBA Finals MVP (Most Valuable Player) 
	of the 2017 - 2018 season. </p>

	<br> <br> <br>
	
	<h3> Toronto Raptors: 2018 - 2019 </h3>
	
	<p> The most surprising win, and also one of the most 
	happiest ones (especially for Canadians) in NBA history.
	Kawaii Leonard was traded from the San Antonio Spurs to
	the Toronto Raptors. Game by game, with strong determination,
	the team passed through the playoffs. One of the most
	iconic moments was the buzzer beater that Kawaii Leonard
	scored in the last seconds of the game against the 
	Philadelphia 76ers. Into the finals, against the Golden
	State Warriors, they won 4 to 2, and became the first 
	team to win a championship title that was outside of the
	United States. The Finals MVP (Most Valuable Player) 
	went to Kawaii Leonard, as he was a key player in their games. </p>
