	<p> Below are the events that occur in the NBA. </p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h3> The Preseason </h3>
	
	<p> The Preseason is where the teams of the NBA start to begin 
	training camps in late September. These allow their coaches to 
	evaluate their players in terms of skills, strength, agility, 
	and weaknesses. These also prepare the players for the regular
	season (later discussed), and determine the 12-man active roster
	in which they would begin with. After training camp, a series 
	of preseason exhibition games are held, sometimes even in 
	locations outside of the country (U.S.A.).  This year, a few 
	preseason games were held in Japan. </p>

	<br> <br>
	
	<h3> The Regular Season </h3>
	
	<p> During the regular season, each team plays a total of 81 
	games, 41 each on their home court and their opponent’s court 
	(away). A team first faces opponents in their own division and
	compete against them for four times (16 games). Then, each team
	plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its 
	conference four times, which makes a total of 24 games. They
	then face the remaining four teams three times, which makes a
	total of 12 games. Finally, each would play all the teams in 
	the other conference twice (30 games). Some of the teams would
	later make it to the playoffs (later discussed), depending on
	the amount of games the team won. </p>

	<br> <br>
	
	<h3> The Playoffs </h3>
	
	<p> The playoffs consist of the top eight teams in each conference,
	depending on the number of times they won. In each conference,
	the first seed (seed is position) goes against the eighth seed,
	the second seed goes against the seventh seed, the third seed 
	competes against the sixth seed, and the fourth seed competes
	against the fifth seed. This means the higher placed teams would
	play weaker teams near the bottom. The team with a better record
	would have the benefit of playing on their home court. The playoffs
	follow a tournament format, in which teams play an opponent in a
	best-out-of-seven series. This means the first team to win four
	games gets to advance to the next round. When two teams in each
	conference are left, they are known to be in the conference finals,
	and would have to play against each other to see who would make it
	to the final playoff round. </p>

	<br> <br>
	
	<h3> The Finals </h3>
	
	<p> In the NBA finals, the victors of both conferences compete 
	on a best-out-of-seven series. The team to win four games, not 
	only wins the Larry O’ Brien Championship Trophy, but each player
	in that team also receives a championship ring. The ring is 
	typically made of precious metals and gems, including diamonds
	and gold, and has a value ranging from 15 to 20 thousand USD. 
	In addition, the NBA also awards the Bill Russell NBA Finals 
	Most Valuable Player Award for the best performing player of
	the series. </p>

	<h3> The All-Star Weekend </h3>
	
	<p> The NBA All-Star Weekend is celebrated annually in the 
	league. This consists of many challenges and attractions. </p>
	
	<h4> The NBA All-Star Game </h4>
	
	<p> The NBA All-Star Game is one of the most popular ones. 
	Fans vote for a captain (from each conference) on each team.
	These votes are counted throughout the United States, Canada,
	and from the Internet. The fans then vote to determine the 
	rest of the starters in the game, in which the coaches vote
	to choose the remaining All-Stars. Then, the captains draft
	players on their team from the pool of All-Stars. The player
	with the best performance during the game would later be 
	rewarded the Game MVP award. </p>

	<h4> The NBA Slam Dunk Contest </h4>
	
	<p> Another favourite from the event is the NBA Slam Dunk 
	Contest, where players compete to dunk the basketball in 
	the most creative and entertaining way, in which the scores
	are given by the judges. </p>

	<br>
	
	<h4> The NBA Three Point Contest </h4>
	
	<p> The Three Point Contest is another well liked attraction
	where players compete to score the highest number of three-point
	field goals in a given time. There are five sections, each with
	five balls in a rack. Whenever a player scores, it equals one
	point. However, the last ball in each rack is called a money 
	ball, where it equals two points. </p>

	<h4> The NBA Skills Contest </h4>
	
	<p> The Skills Challenge is where players compete to finish an 
	obstacle course composed of shooting, dribbling, and passing 
	in the fastest time.  </p>

	<h4> The NBA Rising Stars Challenge </h4>
	
	<p> The Rising Stars Challenge is where the top rookies and 
	second-year players in the NBA play a basketball game with 
	five players on each team. </p>
