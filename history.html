	<h2> The Sport of Basketball </h2>
	
	<p> Before the NBA, it all started with the sport of basketball. 
	Invented by Springfield College instructor and graduate student 
	James Naismith in 1891, the game only used peach baskets and soccer-styled 
	balls. Naismith created the 13 original rules, including the method 
	the ball must be moved, fouls, the game divided into two 15 minute 
	halves with 5 minute resting periods in between, and also appointed 
	a referee. The sport of basketball was an instant success, as after 
	a few weeks passed after the game was invented, students introduced 
	the game at their local sport centres. The game spread like wildfire, 
	and sooner or later, it was introduced to many foreign nations, highschools, 
	and colleges. By 1905, basketball was officially recognized as a permanent 
	winter sport because it was able to be played indoors, while soccer, 
	football, and lacrosse were dominant in the summer. Over the years, 
	there were minor changes over the “thirteen rules” but it was not altered 
	drastically. </p>

	<h2> The Start of The NBA </h2>
	
	<p> The NBA was founded on June 6th, 1946, but at the time was known as the 
	Basketball Association of America (or the BAA). They became the National Basketball 
	Association when they merged with their rival organization, the National Basketball 
	League (NBL). When the two organizations merged, there were a total of 17 teams. 
	However, the new league started to rapidly lose teams, because just after six years, 
	there were only eight teams left. Financial problems started to appear from this, 
	in which Frank Zollner, the owner of the Fort Wayne Pistons in the NBL, was key to 
	keeping the league financially afloat at the time. The NBA continued with only eight 
	teams from 1955 to 1961, when the Chicago Packers (who are now the Washington Wizards) 
	joined the league. The Chicago Bulls then joined the league, and from 1966 to 2004, 
	the league explosively increased to a total of 21 teams. Even after many changes from 
	today, this is what started the real picture of the NBA. </p>

	<h2> The History of The Logo </h2>
	
	<p> When the NBA turned to Alan Siegel, the founder of Siegel+Gale, for the logo, he 
	went through the photo archives of Sport Magazine to seek for inspiration. He found a 
	particular photo of the All-Star Jerry West that grabbed his attention, as the photo 
	was dynamic, vertical, and captured the essence of the game. However, the NBA was 
	reluctant to acknowledge the fact that it is Jerry West in the logo because they wanted 
	to institutionalize the organization rather than individualize it. This classic image 
	generates $3 billion a year for licensing as it symbolizes the peak of excellence in 
	the National Basketball Association. The logo still stands today. </p>
