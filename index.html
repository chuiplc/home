	<p> The NBA, also known as the National Basketball Association, 
	is a men’s professional basketball league in North America. It is composed of thirty franchised 
	teams, in which twenty-nine are located in the U.S. and one in Canada. The NBA is known to 
	be the most popular men’s basketball league in the world, as well as one of the four major 
	sports leagues in Canada and the United States.  </p>
	
	<p> It is extremely difficult to become drafted (or chosen) by the NBA. For instance, out 
	of approximately 547, 500 hardworking highschool basketball players in the United States, 
	only 9% would be able to make it in the NBA. However, that only includes the United States, 
	so the chances may become slimmer as Canadian basketball players can also be drafted and so 
	does other players around the globe.  Therefore, being drafted into the NBA shows a great significance. </p>
